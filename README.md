MyPaint
=======

This was a test project for a certain company.

This solution allows drawing rectangles, lines and ellipses. The brush colour and width are modifiable. The latter is changed by pressing +(=) and - keyboard buttons.
Besides, a user is able to press Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y in order to undo and redo drawing respectively.

This application was created using the C++ language and the SDL library.
